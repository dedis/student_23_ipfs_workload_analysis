# Monitoring and Workload characterization in IPFS

See the report [report_Simon_Jacob_IPFS.pdf](report_Simon_Jacob_IPFS.pdf).

The LaTeX source code is also available: [report_Simon_Jacob_IPFS.zip](report_Simon_Jacob_IPFS.zip).

It is especially recommended to read the background section, as it contains a lot of useful explanations.

For some ideas on future work, read the final chapter of the report.

The slides from the final presentation are also available here: [slides_final_presentation_IPFS.pdf](slides_final_presentation_IPFS.pdf)

This repository is split up into three folders:

- Part 1 contains the code used for to chapter 3 of the report.
- Part 2 contains the code used for to chapter 4 of the report.
- Part 3 contains the code used for to chapter 5 of the report.

Each folder contains a README with more instructions and explanations.

Should any questions or uncertainties arise, feel free to contact me, ideally by creating a Github issue in this repo (as my EPFL email might no longer work).
