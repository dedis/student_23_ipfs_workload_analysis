# Monitoring and Workload characterization in IPFS
See the report [Simon_Jacob_IPFS_monitoring_workload_characterization.pdf](Simon_Jacob_IPFS_monitoring_workload_characterization.pdf).
The LaTeX source code is also available: [Simon_Jacob_IPFS_monitoring_workload_characterization.zip](Simon_Jacob_IPFS_monitoring_workload_characterization.zip).
It is especially recommended to read the background section, as it contains a lot of useful explanations.
For some ideas on future work, read the final chapter of the report.

This repository is split up into three folders:

- Part 1 contains the code used for to chapter 3 of the report.
- Part 2 contains the code used for to chapter 4 of the report.
- Part 3 contains the code used for to chapter 5 of the report.

Each folder contains a README with more instructions and explanations.

Should any questions or uncertainties arise, feel free to contact me, ideally by creating a Github issue in this repo (as my EPFL email might no longer work).
